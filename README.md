# The-2048-Game
2048 is a deceptively simple yet incredibly addictive puzzle game that has captivated players since its inception. The premise is straightforward: you start with a 4x4 grid, and your objective is to combine tiles to reach the elusive 2048 tile. However, achieving this goal is far from easy and requires strategic thinking, foresight, and a fair bit of luck.

Each turn, you can slide all the tiles on the grid in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right. When you do so, all the tiles will move in that direction until they hit the edge of the grid or another tile. If two tiles of the same number collide, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values. The catch is that with each move you make, a new tile of either 2 or 4 appears on the grid, making it increasingly crowded and challenging to maneuver.

The game may seem simple at first, but as you progress and the grid fills up, your options become more limited, and each move becomes critical. You must carefully plan your moves to create larger tiles and prevent the grid from filling up entirely, as a gridlock means game over.

What makes 2048 so compelling is its perfect blend of simplicity and complexity. Anyone can pick it up and start playing within seconds, yet mastering the game requires strategic thinking, pattern recognition, and patience. Each game is a unique puzzle to solve, and there's always that tantalizing promise of reaching the elusive 2048 tile, or even higher for those ambitious players.

1. This project is made using HTML, JAVASCRIPT and CSS.
2. It involves of CSS maths to calculate position of tile wrt grid.
3. Use of CSS animation and transition while appearing and moving tiles
4. Use of Async await for the animation to be finished and then the further action takes place.
